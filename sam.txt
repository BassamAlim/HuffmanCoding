Huffman Encoding is one of the simplest algorithms to compress data. Even though it is very
old and simple , it is still widely used (eg : in few stages of JPEG, MPEG etc). In this project you 
will implement Huffman encoding and decoding. You can read up in Wikipedia or any other 
tutorial.
Your system must accept a file and (Huffman) tree for the same.
During you need to form a binary the construction of Huffman tree, use the priority queue to select 
nodes with smallest frequencies. Once you have constructed the tree, traverse the tree and create a 
dictionary of codewords (letter to code). Given any new sentences, your system must show how 
the sentence is converted to Huffman code and then decoded back to original sentence.
Note that you must implement BST and Heap yourself and must not rely on any language libraries. 
You can use external libraries like GraphViz to display your Huffman tree.
